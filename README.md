## 🗺️ The 12-Phase Roadmap
Based on the structured curriculum, this roadmap focuses on the transition from a "Model-Centric" to a "System-Centric" engineer.

### 🧬 Phase 1-4: Foundations & Deep Modeling
* **01. Math & Statistics:** The bedrock for evaluation and debugging systems.
* **02. DSA for AI Engineering:** Optimizing for high-performance and streaming data.
* **03. Machine Learning:** Focusing on ML as a decision-making system.
* **04. Deep Learning:** Understanding scaling laws and failure modes in neural networks.

### ⚡ Phase 5-8: System Architecture & Data
* **05. NLP & GenAI:** Mastery of RAG pipelines, LLMs, and Agentic workflows.
* **06. Data Engineering for AI:** Building honest, reproducible, and versioned data pipelines.
* **07. Model Evaluation & Testing:** Failure-driven testing and decision quality metrics.
* **08. AI System Design:** Designing stable orchestration around probabilistic components.

### 🚀 Phase 9-12: Production & Future-Proofing
* **09. MLOps & LLMOps:** CI/CD, deployment strategies, and incident handling.
* **10. Cost, Latency & Scale:** Optimizing the anatomy of token costs and throughput.
* **11. Human Factors & UX:** Trustworthy AI design and human-in-the-loop systems.
* **12. Strategic Updates:** Adapting to the fast-evolving AI landscape without "FOMO."
